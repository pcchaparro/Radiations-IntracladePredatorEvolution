# Radiations-IntracladePredatorEvolution
This repository contains the MATLAB code associated to the paper entitled "The enrichment paradox in adaptive radiations: emergence of predators hinders diversification in resource rich environments".

To make the figures 1, 2A, and 3 please run the rutine MakeFigures123. This may take 5 minutes or more to run, depending on the machine.

This repository also includes the code to simulate the adaptation using an individual-based model (see supporting information of the paper). This rutine can take hours to run.
