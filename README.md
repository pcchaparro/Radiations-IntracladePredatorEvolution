# Radiations-IntracladePredatorEvolution
This repository contains the MATLAB code associated to the paper entitled "The enrichment paradox in adaptive radiations: emergence of predators hinders diversification in resource rich environments".

To make the figures 1, 2A, and 3 please run the rutine MakeFigures123. This may take 5 minutes or more to run, depending on the machine.

This repository also includes the code to produce other figures of the paper but they can take several hours to run!!!
The files (rutines) with names corresponding to a figure in the paper can be run independently to produce such figure, but as indicated above, they may take hours running.
